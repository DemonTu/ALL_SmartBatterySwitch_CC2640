 * OAD_IMG_VER() sets the least significant bit of the build version to signify
 * which image region the image is built to run in.  If the LSB is set to 1, 
 * then the Image B region is intended.  Otherwise, it is built for the image A
 * region.  When that builds Image Header is sent OTA to the currently running 
 * Image, OAD_IMG_ID() is performed as a simple check to make sure that the 
 * current Image running and  the Image to OTD are not both and Image A or 
 * Image B builds.  OAD_VER_NUM() unmodifies the OAD image version number for
 * uses such as writing to the LCD.
